# PyData Workshop

This hands-on workshop trains students to analyze spatial data using the Python programming language, open source tools, and public data. Notebooks are presentable as slides with the Jupyter extension [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/).

Topics to be covered include:

  - Fundamentals of programming with Python and Jupyter notebooks
  - Cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing spatial data
  - Visualizing data in Python with charts, graphs, and tables
  - Accessing public data from the web and APIs
  - Mapping spatial data with open source GIS

The workshop material is heavily based on [CP255: Urban Informatics and Visualization](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1462984), a course at the University of California, Berkeley, Department of City and Regional Planning, with work by Professor Paul Waddell and others. Some resources are also based on [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/) and [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/) documentation, as well as the books _[Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)_ by Wes McKinney and _[Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)_ by Allen Downey.
