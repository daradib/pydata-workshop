# PyData Workshop

This hands-on workshop covers analysis of spatial data using the Python programming language, open source tools, and public data.

Notebooks are presented as slides with the Jupyter extension [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/). To navigate the presentation, press `Space` (or `PgDn`) to proceed to the next slide, `Shift-Space` (or `PgUp`) to go backward, and `Shift-Enter` to execute a code cell.

Binder launches sometimes fail. To run locally instead, [install RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) and launch with the classic Jupyter Notebook. RISE is not currently compatible with JupyterLab.

The workshop material is heavily based on [CP255: Urban Informatics and Visualization](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1462984), a course at the University of California, Berkeley, Department of City and Regional Planning, with work by Professor Paul Waddell and others. Some resources are also based on [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/) and [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/) documentation, as well as the books _[Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)_ by Wes McKinney and _[Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)_ by Allen Downey.
