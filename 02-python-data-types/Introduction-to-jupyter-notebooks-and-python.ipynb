    "Python is an interpreted programming language, also referred to as a *high-level language*, or as a scripting language.  What this means is that when you write some commands, or statements that are meaningful in the Python language, the Python 'interpreter' reads the command, figures out what the intended computation is, and then executes it.  This differs from *low-level* languages like C or C++, in which you generally have to compile code  before you can run it, and if you find errors they have to be diagnosed and then the code re-compiled before you can run it.  Interpreted languages skip the compile step, and just execute code directly, and if there are errors, they are seen at run-time.  "

    "\n",
    "This first session will cover the basics of Python, and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data.  The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser, called a Jupyter Notebook.  It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively, with the results appearing inline.  We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now.  Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook.  Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.  \n",

    "To begin using a Jupyter Notebook on your own computer, you need to launch a command prompt (or command shell).  If you don't know what this is, you'll need to get familiar with the command prompt and navigating around on your computer using change directory commands, in order to be able to launch the notebook. The Lab computers have been upgraded to Windows 10.  In this version of Windows, there are multiple ways to open a command prompt - nicely explained here: http://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a mac, you can launch the terminal app.  Once you have a shell, navigate (change directory) to whatever directory you want to work in. If you haven't learned how to use a command prompt in windows, this is a good reference for the command prompt in Windows: http://dosprompt.info/. On a mac, the syntax is a bit different since it is based on Linux.  Here is a reference for commands on the mac: http://ss64.com/osx/, or a simpler version here: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-basic-unix-commands-to-work-in-terminal.html.

The convention of using **.py** as the suffix for a Python script makes it easy to find and run such scripts and to have the Python interpreter parse the statements and execute them one at a time, from top to bottom, as though they had been entered interactively (there are some minor differences in how the interpreter parses interactive commands as compared to scripts, but we will ignore that for now).\n",

The convention is to use a # sign at the beginning of the line to indicate that that line is a comment, and not to be parsed and executed by Python.
